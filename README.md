# unit_1_compile
For running project just make build_and_run.sh executable and run it.

Java project build tools:
- Shell script
- Ant
- Maven

Remark:
If you have any errors first time running script, run it again. If have any problem with maven running from console, try to use IDE or declare newer version of jdk in JAVA_HOME
